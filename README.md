# rouge.js

> Javascript library for interacting with the Rouge protocol V0

âš  **DEPRECATED VERSION:** This version of the repository is no longer maintained and has been deprecated. Please refer to the updated [Rouge Protocol V2](https://github.com/TheRougeProject/v2-core). We strongly encourage you to use the latest version for improved functionality, bug fixes, and ongoing support.

## Installation

Install via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

```bash
	npm i web3 rouge.js
```

or [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn)

```bash
	yarn add web3 rouge.js
```

`rouge.js` depends on two modules (`web3-eth` and `web3-utils`) of the
[web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.4/) library.

## Bundlers help

`rouge.js` is compiled as a collection of [CommonJS](http://webpack.github.io/docs/commonjs.html) modules & [ES2015 modules](https://2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html) for bundlers that support the `module` field in package.json (Rollup, Webpack 2).

## CDN

If you don't use a package manager, you can access `rouge.js` via
[jsDelivr](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/rouge.js/) or
[unpkg](https://unpkg.com/rouge.js/), download the source, or point
your package manager to the url.

The `rouge.js` package includes a precompiled and minified
[UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) build in the
[`dist/`folder](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/rouge.js/dist/).
It can be used directly without a bundler and is thus compatible with
many popular JavaScript module loaders and environments. You can drop
a UMD build as a [`<script>`
tag](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/rouge.js) on your page. The UMD
builds make `rouge.js` available as a `window.Rouge` global variable.

Direct minified UMD url:
* jsDelivr: [https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/rouge.js](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/rouge.js)
* or unpkg: [https://unpkg.com/rouge.js/dist/rouge.umd.min.js](https://unpkg.com/rouge.js/dist/rouge.umd.min.js)

## Usage

Using [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.4/), creating a
campaign can be as simple as these few lines:

```js
import Web3 from 'web3'
import { RougeProtocol } from 'rouge.js'

const web3 = new Web3(<provider>)
const myAccount = web3.eth.accounts.privateKeyToAccount(<privateKey>)

const rouge = RougeProtocol(web3)
const campaign = rouge.as(myAccount).createCampaign()
```
